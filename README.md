# Pin My Map

Pin My Map offers users the ability to record places they have visited using the Mapbox API. Users can pin locations on a world map, add notes and photos, as well as share their personalised map page on social networks. It is built using Next.JS 13 with app router, tailwind CSS, server actions to handle requests server side and NextAuth for user authentication. This is coupled with a PostgresSQL database using Prisma ORM.
